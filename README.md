E-commerce Bookstore Web Application
</h4>


## Project Overview
"Paperback_Portal" is an e-commerce web application tailored for selling books online. Built upon the core technologies of Java EE, including Java Servlets, JSP, JSTL, and integrated with the Hibernate framework, this application exemplifies a sophisticated, fully operational online bookstore.

Java Servlet, JSP, and JSTL are foundational technologies of Java EE, crucial for any Java developer stepping into web application development. Mastery of these core technologies is essential before progressing to more advanced frameworks.

Hibernate, a widely recognized ORM framework, facilitates efficient data access layer programming, allowing for more straightforward database interactions.

## Features
